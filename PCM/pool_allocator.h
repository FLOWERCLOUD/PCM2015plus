/**
	 * Pooled storage allocator
	 *
	 * The following routines allow for the efficient allocation of storage in
	 * small chunks from a specified pool.  Rather than allowing each structure
	 * to be freed individually, an entire pool of storage is freed at once.
	 * This method has two advantages over just using malloc() and free().  First,
	 * it is far more efficient for allocating small objects, as there is
	 * no overhead for remembering all the information needed to free each
	 * object or consolidating fragmented memory.  Second, the decision about
	 * how long to keep an object is made at the time of allocation, and there
	 * is no need to track down all the objects to free them.
